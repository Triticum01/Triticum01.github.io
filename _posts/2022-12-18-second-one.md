With VMs, traditional apps run on native hardware abstracted by a Hypervisor. A single app does not typically use the full resources of a single compute host. Organizations could run multiple copies of the same app, but to provide isolation, they can use VMs to run multiple app instances (VMs) on the same hardware. These VMs have full operating system stacks that make them relatively large and inefficient due to duplication both at runtime and on disk. Containers are a standard way to package apps and all their dependencies for seamless movement between environments. Unlike VMs, containers do not bundle the operating system. Only the app code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings are packaged inside containers. Containers are more lightweight, portable, and efficient than VMs.
